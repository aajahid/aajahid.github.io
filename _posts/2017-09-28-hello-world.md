summary: I had my first website back in 2008, when Nitul vai gave me a free domain/hosting! But I'm so cheap that, after that I never renewed that website! Being a professional web developer ( Sounds so cheasy in 2017! ) building so many website for many clients, I myself didn't have my personal website!

I had my first website back in 2008, when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hfarizz">Nitul</a> vai gave me a free domain/hosting! 
But I'm so cheap that, after that I never renewed that website!

Wayback machine still got that website cached in their database. Have a look - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091211230527/http://shakti-world.com" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20091211230527/http://shakti-world.com</a> 

Looking back - having that personal website really inspired me to learn more about programming! It gave me a platform to test different things... I spent so much time building so many different designs for my website. Oh those days! I didn't even knew about firebug - had to open every source files on browser to debug :p

And you know what, I'm quit happy with the color choices I made for the website! It was 2008 and I was 15! I was asked so many times about that animated logo! ( Incase if you are also wondering - it was made with Cool3d )


Well its been a while (9 years!). I made so many web projects, made so many websites, yet I didn't made one for myself!

 And lots of things has changed since then except - I'm still cheap! Recently while making a demo page for my ReactVR project <a href="https://github.com/aajahid/vrGallery" target="_blank">vrGallery</a> on Github pages, I realize I can use github pages to make a simple blog for me.


### And here we are! "Hello World" ### 
Hopefully I'll be able to regularly write my thougts and things that I'm intestest about.
