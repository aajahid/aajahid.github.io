I often get asked about chaldal.com tech stack on social media. I tried to answer them - but they are scattered around in different group and aren't up to date.

So I decided to write a seperate post with up to date information about chaldal.com tech stack.

## TLDR
The TLDR version of the post is - F#, C#, MSSQL, .Net, React, React-Native, Azure cloud

----

I'll try to explain whole stack with more details. Incase you already don't know, there are many other projects in Chaldal other than the chaldal.com website that we all see and love ;). So here I'll try to seperate them based on projects. Starting with chaldal.com itself.

### Chaldal.com
As already told in TLDR, chaldal.com usages F#, C#, MSSQL, .net, react and react-native. 

#### Backend / API
1. C#
2. F#
3. .Net
4. MSSQL

Originally written in C# but we are transitioning more into F#. Because we love functional programming and the awesome type safety F# provides. I'll write more in details why we love F#. Some legacy code still usages .Net framework but we are transition into .netcore. 

MSSQL as primary database. 

We host on our own servers, distributed into 3 data center, in two city ( 2 in Dhaka, 1 in Jashore).

We use microsoft Azure dev-ops for development. Also use Azure pipeline for CI/CD.

#### Frontend

1. ReactJS
2. ExpressJS

Chaldal frontend is well known in local dev community for its snappy performance. Originally written back in 2013, when reactjs just got released - the website performance was a surprise for most of the people. I remember when I first used chaldal.com even before joining Chaldal - I was suprised when I toggled the language (the instant change of the language).

Some might think its fast because of just using reactjs. But thats not true. Yeah - reactjs did facilate it, but it was very carefull thought and architecture that made the whole experience. Here are some breakdown 

1. **Server Side Rendering**: Fast first paint with the help of SSR
2. **No blocking network request**: Again to help with the fast first paint - there is no blocking assets. It analyzes the request and inline styles along with html.
3. **Preload freqently used data**: Data like banners, categories, stores, locale, delivery slots data are hydrate into frontend when the webpage loads. 
4. **Preloaded logic**: We also preload some dynamic logic from backend. Like price calculation, Discount avaialibity, delivery slot distribution etc. Usually to prevent duplication of such business logic, people rely on backend and had to make frequent API call. To overcome this challange - we came up with a solution where we can share these business logic in cross platform manner. This is why we don't even need to rely on backend to calculate shopping cart total. Which makes adding product to shopping cart seamless. I'll write more about this in future.
5. **Caching on FE server**: We cache some less dynamic content on the FE server. This way we don't overwhealm the backend and also avoid making slower API call.
6. **No loader**: We try to make the website work without any loader animation. To achieve that - there are few strategy we follow. 
    1. Preload contents
    2. Structure in a way when API call is a must, we make the UI change first and do the API call later. In case of failure - we update the UI again. Example - When we add a product to cart - we do make an API call - but we don't delay adding the product to cart in FE. We first add the product to cart visually and then make the API call. 
    3. Skelton loader/fade instead of spinning loader. Because spinner loader makes whole UI refresh with just an small spinner. The visual change is big make you the user experience bad. Instead fade/skeletong loader.  
7. **CDN**: Serving css, JS and images through properly implemented CDN. 
8. **Image Loader**: Custom image loader - which gives us control on order and quantity of image loading. Also load different quality image based on user internet connection and device pixel density. 

### Mobile App

**iOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaldal-online-grocery/id1104493220?platform=iphone

1. React Native
2. MobX

Originally our mobile was written using Xamarin. But I rewrote the app from scratch back in 2019. 
Historically - we didn't really invest that much on our mobile app but this has changed recently with new our UX team.
